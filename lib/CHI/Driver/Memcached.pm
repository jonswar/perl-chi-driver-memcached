=head1 NAME

CHI::Driver::Memcached -- Distributed cache via memcached (memory cache daemon)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use CHI;

    my $cache = CHI->new(
        driver => 'Memcached',   # or 'Memcached::Fast', or 'Memcached::libmemcached'
        namespace => 'products',
        servers => [ "10.0.0.15:11211", "10.0.0.15:11212", "/var/sock/memcached",
        "10.0.0.17:11211", [ "10.0.0.17:11211", 3 ] ],
        debug => 0,
        compress_threshold => 10_000,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CHI driver that uses Cache::Memcached to store data in the specified
memcached server(s).

L<CHI::Driver::Memcached::Fast> and L<CHI::Driver::Memcached::libmemcached> are
also available as part of this distribution. They work with other Memcached
clients and support a similar feature set. Documentation for all three modules
is presented below.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS

Namespace, appended with ":", is passed along to the Cached::Memcached::*
constructor, along with any constructor options L<not recognized by
CHI|CHI/constructor> - for example I<servers>, I<compress_threshold> and
I<debug>.

If you need more control over the options passed to Cache::Memcached::*, you
may specify a hash directly in C<memd_params>.

=head1 METHODS

Besides the standard CHI methods:

=over

=item memd

Returns a handle to the underlying Cache::Memcached::* object. You can use this
to call memcached-specific methods that are not supported by the general API,
e.g.

    $self->memd->incr("key");
    my $stats = $self->memd->stats();

=back

=head1 UNSUPPORTED METHODS

These standard CHI methods cannot currently be supported by memcached, chiefly
because there is no way to get a list of stored keys.

=over

=item dump_as_hash

=item clear

=item get_keys

=item get_namespaces

=item is_empty

=item purge

=back
